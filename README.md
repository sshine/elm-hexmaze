# elm-hexmaze

"Upon reading RedBlobGames' guide to [hexagonal grids](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/),
I wonder if someone made a package available for rendering hexagonal mazes with Elm." The answer is yes.
The heavy listing is performed by Vyacheslav Voronchuk in [Voronchuk/hexagons](https://github.com/Voronchuk/hexagons).

```
$ elm make src/Main.elm
```
