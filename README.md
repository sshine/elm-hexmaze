# elm-hexmaze

Upon reading RedBlobGames' guide to [hexagonal grids][redblobgames], I wondered
if someone had made a package available for rendering hexagonal mazes with Elm.
The answer was yes.  The heavy lifting is performed by Vyacheslav Voronchuk in
[Voronchuk/hexagons][voronchuk].

```
$ elm make src/Main.elm
```
